We have found the following guidelines very effective:

- Have no more than 5 graphs on a console.
- Have no more than 5 plots (lines) on each graph. You can get away with more if it is a stacked/area graph.
- When using the provided console template examples, avoid more than 20-30 entries in the right-hand-side table.
