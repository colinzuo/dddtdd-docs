The panel is the basic visualization building block in Grafana. Each panel has a **query editor** specific to the **data source** selected in the panel. The query editor allows you to build a query that returns the data you want to visualize.

There are a wide variety of styling and formatting options for each panel. Panels can be **dragged, dropped, and resized** to rearrange them on the dashboard
