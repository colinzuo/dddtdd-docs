# Scalars

In NumPy, there are **24** new fundamental Python types to describe different types of scalars. These type descriptors are mostly based on the types available in the C language that CPython is written in, with several additional types compatible with Python’s types

## Built-in scalar types

| Array scalar type | Related Python type |
| ---- | ---- |
| double | float   |
| datetime64 | datetime.datetime   |

The default data type in NumPy is `double`.

### Floating-point types

#### double

Double-precision floating-point number type, compatible with Python `float` and C `double`

alias: `numpy.float64`
