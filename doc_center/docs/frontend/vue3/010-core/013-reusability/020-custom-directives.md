# Custom Directives

A custom directive is defined as an object **containing lifecycle hooks** similar to those of a component. The hooks **receive the element** the directive is bound to

In `<script setup>`, any camelCase variable that **starts with the v prefix** can be used as a custom directive

```ts
<script setup>
// enables v-focus in templates
const vFocus = {
  mounted: (el) => el.focus()
}
</script>

<template>
  <input v-focus />
</template>
```

```ts
const app = createApp({})

// make v-focus usable in all components
app.directive('focus', {
  /* ... */
})
```

## Directive Hooks

```js
const myDirective = {
  // called before bound element's attributes
  // or event listeners are applied
  created(el, binding, vnode) {
    // see below for details on arguments
  },
  // called right before the element is inserted into the DOM.
  beforeMount(el, binding, vnode) {},
  // called when the bound element's parent component
  // and all its children are mounted.
  mounted(el, binding, vnode) {},
  // called before the parent component is updated
  beforeUpdate(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},
  // called after the parent component and
  // all of its children have updated
  updated(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},
  // called before the parent component is unmounted
  beforeUnmount(el, binding, vnode) {},
  // called when the parent component is unmounted
  unmounted(el, binding, vnode) {}
}
```
