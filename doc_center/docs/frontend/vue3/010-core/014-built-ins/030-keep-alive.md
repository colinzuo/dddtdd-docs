# KeepAlive

## Basic Usage

```html
<!-- Inactive components will be cached! -->
<KeepAlive>
  <component :is="activeComponent" />
</KeepAlive>
```

## Include / Exclude

By default, `<KeepAlive>` will cache any component instance inside. We can customize this behavior via the `include` and `exclude` props. Both props can be a comma-delimited string, a `RegExp`, or an array containing either types

The match is checked against the component's `name` option

```html
<!-- comma-delimited string -->
<KeepAlive include="a,b">
  <component :is="view" />
</KeepAlive>

<!-- regex (use `v-bind`) -->
<KeepAlive :include="/a|b/">
  <component :is="view" />
</KeepAlive>

<!-- Array (use `v-bind`) -->
<KeepAlive :include="['a', 'b']">
  <component :is="view" />
</KeepAlive>
```

## Lifecycle of Cached Instance

- Both hooks work for not only the root component cached by `<KeepAlive>`, but also the descendant components in the cached tree

```ts
<script setup>
import { onActivated, onDeactivated } from 'vue'

onActivated(() => {
  // called on initial mount
  // and every time it is re-inserted from the cache
})

onDeactivated(() => {
  // called when removed from the DOM into the cache
  // and also when unmounted
})
</script>
```
