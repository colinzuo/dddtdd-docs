# Why Vite

## The Problems

### Slow Server Start

- **Dependencies** Vite pre-bundles dependencies using esbuild. **esbuild is written in Go** and pre-bundles dependencies 10-100x faster than JavaScript-based bundlers
- **Source code** Vite serves source code over native ESM. This is essentially letting the browser take over part of the job of a bundler: Vite only needs to transform and serve source code on demand, as the browser requests it

### Slow Updates

In Vite, HMR is performed **over native ESM**. When a file is edited, Vite only needs to precisely invalidate the chain between the edited module and its closest HMR boundary
