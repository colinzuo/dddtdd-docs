The [Prometheus Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway) allows you to push time series from short-lived service-level batch jobs to an intermediary job which Prometheus can scrape

- For more information on using the Pushgateway and use from a Unix shell, see the project's [README.md](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway/blob/master/README.md)
- For use from Go see the `Push` and `Add` methods
