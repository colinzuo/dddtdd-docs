All exported functions and methods are safe to be used concurrently unless specified otherwise

In addition to the fundamental metric types Gauge, Counter, Summary, and Histogram, a very important part of the Prometheus data model is the partitioning of samples along dimensions called labels, which results in metric vectors. The fundamental types are GaugeVec, CounterVec, SummaryVec, and HistogramVec.

## Functions

- `func Register(c Collector) error`
- `func Unregister(c Collector) bool`

## Collector

```go
type Collector interface {
	// Describe sends the super-set of all possible descriptors of metrics
	// collected by this Collector to the provided channel and returns once
	// the last descriptor has been sent. The sent descriptors fulfill the
	// consistency and uniqueness requirements described in the Desc
	// documentation.
	//
	// It is valid if one and the same Collector sends duplicate
	// descriptors. Those duplicates are simply ignored. However, two
	// different Collectors must not send duplicate descriptors.
	//
	// Sending no descriptor at all marks the Collector as “unchecked”,
	// i.e. no checks will be performed at registration time, and the
	// Collector may yield any Metric it sees fit in its Collect method.
	//
	// This method idempotently sends the same descriptors throughout the
	// lifetime of the Collector. It may be called concurrently and
	// therefore must be implemented in a concurrency safe way.
	//
	// If a Collector encounters an error while executing this method, it
	// must send an invalid descriptor (created with NewInvalidDesc) to
	// signal the error to the registry.
	Describe(chan<- *Desc)
	// Collect is called by the Prometheus registry when collecting
	// metrics. The implementation sends each collected metric via the
	// provided channel and returns once the last metric has been sent. The
	// descriptor of each sent metric is one of those returned by Describe
	// (unless the Collector is unchecked, see above). Returned metrics that
	// share the same descriptor must differ in their variable label
	// values.
	//
	// This method may be called concurrently and must therefore be
	// implemented in a concurrency safe way. Blocking occurs at the expense
	// of total performance of rendering all registered metrics. Ideally,
	// Collector implementations support concurrent readers.
	Collect(chan<- Metric)
}
```

## Counter

```go
type Counter interface {
	Metric
	Collector

	// Inc increments the counter by 1. Use Add to increment it by arbitrary
	// non-negative values.
	Inc()
	// Add adds the given value to the counter. It panics if the value is <
	// 0.
	Add(float64)
}
```

- `func NewCounter(opts CounterOpts) Counter`

## CounterVec

```go
type CounterVec struct {
	*MetricVec
}
```

CounterVec is a Collector that bundles a set of Counters that all share the same Desc, **but have different values for their variable labels**. This is used if you want to count the same thing partitioned by various dimensions (e.g. number of HTTP requests, partitioned by response code and method)

```go
	httpReqs := prometheus.NewCounterVec(
		prometheus.CounterOpts{
			Name: "http_requests_total",
			Help: "How many HTTP requests processed, partitioned by status code and HTTP method.",
		},
		[]string{"code", "method"},
	)
	prometheus.MustRegister(httpReqs)

	httpReqs.WithLabelValues("404", "POST").Add(42)
```

- `func NewCounterVec(opts CounterOpts, labelNames []string) *CounterVec`

## Desc

```go
type Desc struct {
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

Desc is the descriptor used by every Prometheus Metric. It is essentially the immutable **meta-data of a Metric**

- `func NewDesc(fqName, help string, variableLabels []string, constLabels Labels) *Desc`

## Gatherer

```go
type Gatherer interface {
	// Gather calls the Collect method of the registered Collectors and then
	// gathers the collected metrics into a lexicographically sorted slice
	// of uniquely named MetricFamily protobufs. Gather ensures that the
	// returned slice is valid and self-consistent so that it can be used
	// for valid exposition. As an exception to the strict consistency
	// requirements described for metric.Desc, Gather will tolerate
	// different sets of label names for metrics of the same metric family.
	//
	// Even if an error occurs, Gather attempts to gather as many metrics as
	// possible. Hence, if a non-nil error is returned, the returned
	// MetricFamily slice could be nil (in case of a fatal error that
	// prevented any meaningful metric collection) or contain a number of
	// MetricFamily protobufs, some of which might be incomplete, and some
	// might be missing altogether. The returned error (which might be a
	// MultiError) explains the details. Note that this is mostly useful for
	// debugging purposes. If the gathered protobufs are to be used for
	// exposition in actual monitoring, it is almost always better to not
	// expose an incomplete result and instead disregard the returned
	// MetricFamily protobufs in case the returned error is non-nil.
	Gather() ([]*dto.MetricFamily, error)
}
```

## Gauge

```go
type Gauge interface {
	Metric
	Collector

	// Set sets the Gauge to an arbitrary value.
	Set(float64)
	// Inc increments the Gauge by 1. Use Add to increment it by arbitrary
	// values.
	Inc()
	// Dec decrements the Gauge by 1. Use Sub to decrement it by arbitrary
	// values.
	Dec()
	// Add adds the given value to the Gauge. (The value can be negative,
	// resulting in a decrease of the Gauge.)
	Add(float64)
	// Sub subtracts the given value from the Gauge. (The value can be
	// negative, resulting in an increase of the Gauge.)
	Sub(float64)

	// SetToCurrentTime sets the Gauge to the current Unix time in seconds.
	SetToCurrentTime()
}
```

- `func NewGauge(opts GaugeOpts) Gauge`

## Histogram

```go
type Histogram interface {
	Metric
	Collector

	// Observe adds a single observation to the histogram. Observations are
	// usually positive or zero. Negative observations are accepted but
	// prevent current versions of Prometheus from properly detecting
	// counter resets in the sum of observations. (The experimental Native
	// Histograms handle negative observations properly.) See
	// https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/histograms/#count-and-sum-of-observations
	// for details.
	Observe(float64)
}
```

```go
	temps := prometheus.NewHistogram(prometheus.HistogramOpts{
		Name:    "pond_temperature_celsius",
		Help:    "The temperature of the frog pond.", // Sorry, we can't measure how badly it smells.
		Buckets: prometheus.LinearBuckets(20, 5, 5),  // 5 buckets, each 5 centigrade wide.
	})

	// Simulate some observations.
	for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
		temps.Observe(30 + math.Floor(120*math.Sin(float64(i)*0.1))/10)
	}
```    

## Labels

- `type Labels map[string]string`

```go
myVec.With(Labels{"code": "404", "method": "GET"}).Add(42)
```

## Metric

```go
type Metric interface {
	// Desc returns the descriptor for the Metric. This method idempotently
	// returns the same descriptor throughout the lifetime of the
	// Metric. The returned descriptor is immutable by contract. A Metric
	// unable to describe itself must return an invalid descriptor (created
	// with NewInvalidDesc).
	Desc() *Desc
	// Write encodes the Metric into a "Metric" Protocol Buffer data
	// transmission object.
	//
	// Metric implementations must observe concurrency safety as reads of
	// this metric may occur at any time, and any blocking occurs at the
	// expense of total performance of rendering all registered
	// metrics. Ideally, Metric implementations should support concurrent
	// readers.
	//
	// While populating dto.Metric, it is the responsibility of the
	// implementation to ensure validity of the Metric protobuf (like valid
	// UTF-8 strings or syntactically valid metric and label names). It is
	// recommended to sort labels lexicographically. Callers of Write should
	// still make sure of sorting if they depend on it.
	Write(*dto.Metric) error
}
```

## MetricVec

```go
type MetricVec struct {
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

MetricVec is not used directly but as a building block for implementations of vectors of a given metric type, like `GaugeVec, CounterVec, SummaryVec, and HistogramVec`. It is exported so that it can be used for custom Metric implementations.

## MultiError

`type MultiError []error`

## Observer

```go
type Observer interface {
	Observe(float64)
}
```

Observer is the interface that wraps the Observe method, which is used by Histogram and Summary to add observations

## Opts

```go
type Opts struct {
	// Namespace, Subsystem, and Name are components of the fully-qualified
	// name of the Metric (created by joining these components with
	// "_"). Only Name is mandatory, the others merely help structuring the
	// name. Note that the fully-qualified name of the metric must be a
	// valid Prometheus metric name.
	Namespace string
	Subsystem string
	Name      string

	// Help provides information about this metric.
	//
	// Metrics with the same fully-qualified name must have the same Help
	// string.
	Help string

	// ConstLabels are used to attach fixed labels to this metric. Metrics
	// with the same fully-qualified name must have the same label names in
	// their ConstLabels.
	//
	// ConstLabels are only used rarely. In particular, do not use them to
	// attach the same labels to all your metrics. Those use cases are
	// better covered by target labels set by the scraping Prometheus
	// server, or by one specific metric (e.g. a build_info or a
	// machine_role metric). See also
	// https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#target-labels-not-static-scraped-labels
	ConstLabels Labels
}
```

It is mandatory to set Name to a non-empty string. All other fields are optional and can safely be left at their zero value, although it is strongly encouraged to set a Help string.

## Registerer

```go
type Registerer interface {
	// Register registers a new Collector to be included in metrics
	// collection. It returns an error if the descriptors provided by the
	// Collector are invalid or if they — in combination with descriptors of
	// already registered Collectors — do not fulfill the consistency and
	// uniqueness criteria described in the documentation of metric.Desc.
	//
	// If the provided Collector is equal to a Collector already registered
	// (which includes the case of re-registering the same Collector), the
	// returned error is an instance of AlreadyRegisteredError, which
	// contains the previously registered Collector.
	//
	// A Collector whose Describe method does not yield any Desc is treated
	// as unchecked. Registration will always succeed. No check for
	// re-registering (see previous paragraph) is performed. Thus, the
	// caller is responsible for not double-registering the same unchecked
	// Collector, and for providing a Collector that will not cause
	// inconsistent metrics on collection. (This would lead to scrape
	// errors.)
	Register(Collector) error
	// MustRegister works like Register but registers any number of
	// Collectors and panics upon the first registration that causes an
	// error.
	MustRegister(...Collector)
	// Unregister unregisters the Collector that equals the Collector passed
	// in as an argument.  (Two Collectors are considered equal if their
	// Describe method yields the same set of descriptors.) The function
	// returns whether a Collector was unregistered. Note that an unchecked
	// Collector cannot be unregistered (as its Describe method does not
	// yield any descriptor).
	//
	// Note that even after unregistering, it will not be possible to
	// register a new Collector that is inconsistent with the unregistered
	// Collector, e.g. a Collector collecting metrics with the same name but
	// a different help string. The rationale here is that the same registry
	// instance must only collect consistent metrics throughout its
	// lifetime.
	Unregister(Collector) bool
}
```

## Registry

```go
type Registry struct {
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

It implements `Registerer, Gatherer, and Collector`

```go
	// Create a global registry.
	globalReg := prometheus.NewRegistry()

	// Spawn 10 workers, each of which will have their own group of metrics.
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		// Create a new registry for each worker, which acts as a group of
		// worker-specific metrics.
		workerReg := prometheus.NewRegistry()
		globalReg.Register(workerReg)

		go func(workerID int) {
			// Once the worker is done, it can unregister itself.
			defer globalReg.Unregister(workerReg)

			workTime := prometheus.NewCounter(prometheus.CounterOpts{
				Name: "worker_total_work_time_milliseconds",
				ConstLabels: prometheus.Labels{
					// Generate a label unique to this worker so its metric doesn't
					// collide with the metrics from other workers.
					"worker_id": fmt.Sprintf("%d", workerID),
				},
			})
			workerReg.MustRegister(workTime)

			start := time.Now()
			time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * time.Duration(rand.Intn(100)))
			workTime.Add(float64(time.Since(start).Milliseconds()))
		}(i)
	}
```

## Timer

```go
type Timer struct {
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

- `func NewTimer(o Observer) *Timer`

The provided Observer is used to observe a duration in seconds

```go
func TimeMe() {
    timer := NewTimer(myHistogram)
    defer timer.ObserveDuration()
    // Do actual work.
}
```

```go
var apiRequestDuration = prometheus.NewHistogramVec(
	prometheus.HistogramOpts{
		Name:    "api_request_duration_seconds",
		Help:    "Histogram for the request duration of the public API, partitioned by status class.",
		Buckets: prometheus.ExponentialBuckets(0.1, 1.5, 5),
	},
	[]string{"status_class"},
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	status := http.StatusOK
	// The ObserverFunc gets called by the deferred ObserveDuration and
	// decides which Histogram's Observe method is called.
	timer := prometheus.NewTimer(prometheus.ObserverFunc(func(v float64) {
		switch {
		case status >= 500: // Server error.
			apiRequestDuration.WithLabelValues("5xx").Observe(v)
		case status >= 400: // Client error.
			apiRequestDuration.WithLabelValues("4xx").Observe(v)
		case status >= 300: // Redirection.
			apiRequestDuration.WithLabelValues("3xx").Observe(v)
		case status >= 200: // Success.
			apiRequestDuration.WithLabelValues("2xx").Observe(v)
		default: // Informational.
			apiRequestDuration.WithLabelValues("1xx").Observe(v)
		}
	}))
	defer timer.ObserveDuration()

	// Handle the request. Set status accordingly.
	// ...
}
```
