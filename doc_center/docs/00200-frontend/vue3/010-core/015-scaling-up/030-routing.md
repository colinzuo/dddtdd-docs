# Routing

## Client-Side vs. Server-Side Routing

A client-side router is responsible for managing the application's rendered view using browser APIs such as [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) or the [hashchange event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/hashchange_event)

## Official Router

For most SPAs, it's recommended to use the officially-supported [Vue Router library](https://github.com/vuejs/router)
