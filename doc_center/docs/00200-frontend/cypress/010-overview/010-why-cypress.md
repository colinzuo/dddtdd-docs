# Why Cypress?

## In a nutshell

Cypress is most often compared to Selenium; however Cypress is both fundamentally and architecturally different. Cypress is not constrained by the same restrictions as Selenium

## Features

Here is a list of things it can do that no other testing framework can

- **Time Travel**: Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run. Hover over commands in the Command Log to see exactly what happened at each step
- **Debuggability**: Stop guessing why your tests are failing. Debug directly from familiar tools like Developer Tools. Our readable errors and stack traces make debugging lightning fast
- **Automatic Waiting**: Never add waits or sleeps to your tests. Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on. No more async hell
- **Spies, Stubs, and Clocks**: Verify and control the behavior of functions, server responses, or timers. The same functionality you love from unit testing is right at your fingertips
- **Network Traffic Control**: Easily control, stub, and test edge cases without involving your server. You can stub network traffic however you like
- **Consistent Results**: Our architecture doesn't use Selenium or WebDriver. Say hello to fast, consistent and reliable tests that are flake-free
- **Screenshots, Videos, and Test Replay**: View screenshots taken automatically on failure, or videos, if enabled, of your entire test suite when run from the CLI
- **Cross Browser Testing**: Run tests within Firefox and Chrome-family browsers (including Edge and Electron) locally and optimally in a Continuous Integration pipeline

## Cypress in the Real World

**you'll often wonder if you're using best practices or scalable strategies**

To guide the way, the Cypress team has created the [Real World App (RWA)](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app), a full stack example application that demonstrates testing with **Cypress in practical and realistic scenarios**
