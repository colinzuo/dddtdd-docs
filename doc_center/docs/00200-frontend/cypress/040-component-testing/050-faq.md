# Component Testing FAQ

## What is the Mount Function?

We ship a `mount` function for each UI library that is imported from the `cypress` package. It is responsible for rendering components within Cypress's **sandboxed iframe and handling any framework-specific cleanup**

While you can use the mount function in your tests, we recommend using `cy.mount()`, which is added as a custom command in the `cypress/support/component.js` file

```ts
import { mount } from 'cypress/react'

Cypress.Commands.add('mount', mount)
```

This allows you to use `cy.mount()` in any component test without having to import the framework-specific mount command, as well as customizing it to fit your needs

## How do I fix ESLint errors for things like using the global Cypress objects?

If you experience ESLint errors in your code editor around Cypress globals, install the `eslint-plugin-cypress` ESLint plugin
